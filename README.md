Washington DC Bike Sharing User Predictions

In this analysis we have developed a model to predict the number of bike sharing users on an hourly basis in the city of Washington DC.

Based on the historical data for 2 years on the number bike sharing users a regression model was built considering the date of each recording and other related descriptive features such as the temperature and humidity of this specific day.

For this regression model a number of algorithms were tried such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting trees.

To implement the analysis and model summarized above the following libraries were used:
-pandas
-numpy
-sklearn
-dask
